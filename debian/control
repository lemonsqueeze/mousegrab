Description: X11 app to lock mouse to a window
 mousegrab is a small X11 app to lock the mouse to a window and hide it:
 Mouse will be hidden but buttons and mouse wheel still work, and app can
 receive keystrokes. right clicking releases the mouse.
 .
 Useful if you have an optical mouse that jitters when off the floor
 and you'd rather not have it wander all over the place, or you need
 to click on something without worrying about mouse being moved ...
 Especially nice to use with easystroke -> start with mouse gesture !
